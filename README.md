# ChatRGB

This code accompanies the [IKEA Head lamp hack project](https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/ikea-lamp-hack). The code is designed for a [Pimoroni Plasma Stick 2040 W](collabs.shop/fm9pd7), which uses the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

## The code

* [`led_strip_test.py`](led_strip_test.py) - lights up the LED Ring if a sound is heard
